# COD Molecules

Molecular data files generated from the [Crystallographic Open Database](http://crystallography.net/cod/)

At the moment, these are generated via [DataWarrior](http://openmolecules.org/datawarrior/) but will soon be auto-generated from the [COD tools](https://github.com/cod-developers/cod-tools/) themselves.
